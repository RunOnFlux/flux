**This Folder MUST exist**

Until all nodes remove the `bitcoin` package. Once this happens, we can remove
this folder.

The reason for this is that when using `file:` in `package.json`, it symlinks the
package into `node_modules`. If we then delete the source folder, npm has a bad
time and `fluxOS` won't start.
