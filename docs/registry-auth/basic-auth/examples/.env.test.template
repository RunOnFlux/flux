# Basic Authentication Test Configuration
# Copy this file to .env.test and fill in your values

# Registry Credentials
REGISTRY_USERNAME=                  # Your registry username (e.g., Docker Hub username)
REGISTRY_PASSWORD=                  # Your registry password or Personal Access Token (PAT)

# Image Configuration
IMAGE_TAG=                          # Full image tag to test with (e.g., username/image:tag)

# Example filled in for Docker Hub:
# REGISTRY_USERNAME=myusername
# REGISTRY_PASSWORD=dckr_pat_AbCdEf123456789
# IMAGE_TAG=myusername/myimage:latest

# Example filled in for private registry:
# REGISTRY_USERNAME=admin
# REGISTRY_PASSWORD=secretpassword123
# IMAGE_TAG=registry.example.com/myapp:v1.0

# Notes:
# - For Docker Hub, use your Docker Hub username and a Personal Access Token (PAT)
# - For private registries, use the credentials configured on that registry
# - IMAGE_TAG should be the full path including registry (if not Docker Hub)
# - Docker Hub images can be just "username/image:tag" (docker.io is implied)
